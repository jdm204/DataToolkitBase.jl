When writing data configuration TOML file, the keys are (recursively) sorted.
Some keys are particularly important though, and so to ensure they are placed
higher a mappings from such keys to a higher sort priority string can be
registered here.

For example, `"config" => "\0x01"` ensures that the special configuration
section is placed before all of the data sets.

This can cause odd behaviour if somebody gives a dataset the same name as a
special key, but frankly that would be a bit silly (given the key names, e.g.
"uuid") and so this is of minimal concern.
